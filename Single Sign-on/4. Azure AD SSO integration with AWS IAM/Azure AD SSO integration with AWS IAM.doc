AWS IAM Integration with Azure Active Directory

Organizations that operate a multi-account strategy in Amazon Web Services (AWS) with AWS Control Tower 
or AWS Organizations might have a requirement to use Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) single sign-on 
(SSO) for federation into the AWS Management Console. In these situations, AWS IAM Identity Center 
(successor to AWS Single Sign-On) might not always fit into an organizationâ€™s requirements. When this occurs, 
federation is achieved by using an enterprise application within Azure AD named AWS Single-Account Access. 
The application is deployed within Azure AD for each AWS account. 


As described in a Microsoft tutorial on integrating Azure AD SSO with AWS, programmatic access to each integrated 
account must be configured by using an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user in each account. Azure AD uses
the IAM user to retrieve IAM roles to synchronize with Azure AD. Domain administrators map those synchronized roles 
to groups of users within Azure AD to enable those users to federate into AWS with the appropriate IAM role.
