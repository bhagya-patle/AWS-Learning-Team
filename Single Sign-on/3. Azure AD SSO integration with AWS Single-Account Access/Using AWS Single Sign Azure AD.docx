AWS Single Sign-On Integration with Azure Active Directory

I demonstrated how we can integrate Azure AD to AWS Single Sign-On (SSO). With this connection, 
you can now manage access to AWS accounts and apps centrally for single sign-on and utilize automated 
provisioning to decrease complexity when maintaining and utilizing identities. Users no longer need to 
manage multiple identities and passwords to access their AWS accounts and apps since Azure AD can now 
serve as a single source for user management.
